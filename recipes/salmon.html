    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe is a great way of including some Omega-3s and healthy fats in your diet. And it's also extremely delicious.</p>
    <p>
        I love salmon not only because it's very healthy but also for the flavor, especially if it's oven baked and it's topped with some sauce.<br>
        Asparagus and potatoes cook really well with the salmon and they're perfect in combination with it.
