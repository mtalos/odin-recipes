    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A superb and tasty salad that you can't get enough of.</p>
    <p>
        It combines fish, leafy green vegetables, beans, avocado, onions and on top of that it's finished with a delicious dijon vinaigrette.<br>
        My wife and I make this salad every two or three days and we love it.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>a mix of greens like green salad, arugula, spinach, lettuce, etc.</li>
        <li>1 can of tuna (I use in water)</li>
        <li>1 avocado (cubed)</li>
        <li>1 can of red kidney beans</li>
        <li>1 small red onion cut in slices</li>
        <li>salt, pepper, olive oil, pumpkin seeds</li>
        <li>cheese (optional)</li>
        <li>2 slices of bread for making croutons (optional)</li>
        <li><em>for the vinaigrette:</em>
            <ul>
                <li>3 parts olive oil</li>
                <li>1 part lemon juice</li>
                <li>salt, pepper</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon of dijon mustard</li>
                <li>a bit of apple cider vinegar (optional)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the vinaigrette first: add all the ingredients in a jar and shake well. Add more oil/lemon juice if necessary and season to taste.</li>
        <li>Put the greens in a big bowl and pour the vinaigrette on top, mix well with your hands until combined well.</li>
        <li>Add the rest of the ingredients: tuna, beans, avocado, onion, cheese (of your choice, I use cheddar cheese) and a handful of pumpkin seeds and mix well.</li>
        <li>If you want a bit of crunchiness, toast the bread in a pan with olive oil then cut it in small bite-sized pieces and add to the salad.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
