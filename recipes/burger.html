    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A simple burger recipe that I usually make whenever I want something quick, easy and delicious.</p>
    <p>It only takes around 20 minutes to prepare everything and it's perfect for every burger lover.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 beef burger patty (around 150 grams)</li>
        <li>1 hamburger bun</li>
        <li>sriracha or samurai sauce</li>
        <li>1 sliced pickle</li>
        <li>1 slice of tomato</li>
        <li>1 green salad leaf (or any other burger salad)</li>
        <li>2 slices of cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 chilli (or jalapeno) sliced for extra spicyness</li>
        <li>salt, pepper, butter and olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a grill pan on medium-high heat. Cut the bun in half and then toast it in the pan on BOTH sides. In the meantime, season the burger patty with
            salt, pepper and a little bit of olive oil on both sides.
        </li>
        <li>Take the buns out and put the patty on the grill and cook on one side for about 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Prepare the buns while the burger patty is grilling. Spread the spicy sauce of your choice on both bun halves, add the pickle, chilli pepper and then
            the salad leaf (sometimes I use a mix of salad pieces, but it's fine anyway) on the bottom bun. Last, add the tomato on top of the rest or
            on the top bun and then season with salt.
        </li>
        <li>Turn the burger patty over and let it grill for 1 minute and then add a bit of butter on top and let it melt. After that, take the cheese slices
            and put them on the patty. Season lightly with salt and use a lid to help the cheese melt faster.
        </li>
        <li>After about 2 minutes take the patty out and assemble the burger. That's it, enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
